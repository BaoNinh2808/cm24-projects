# EVM Telegram ZK 

This is a research project, include:
- Explore possibilities & limitations of Telegram API & Telegram Mini Apps for integrating EVM wallets
- Research how private key can be stored for wallets integrated in Telegram
- Research how ZK solutions can be used with Telegram Mini Apps

## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

This is a long-term project, we did some research but we alse have more things to do:
- [research] How various self-custodial wallet solutions existing in the market (Ex.: MPC, PassKey, Deterministic keys, etc.) can be integrated in Telegram 
- [dev] [if it makes sense] Build prototypes for each of these self-custodial wallet solutions. Ex.: integration in Telegram via separate Mini App
- [dev] [output code] Make commits to GitHub repo with working prototype code written during this Milestone. To demonstrate what was explored, validated, results achieved, etc.
- [dev] [if it makes sense] Create unit-tests
- [documentation] Write down takeaways, results (even if they are negative), tutorial / guideline, etc. So everything is documented 



## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

EVM wallet + OAUTH + Telegram's combination does not have a direct solution available, So we did R&D about it.

Although a complete solution is not yet available, we also learned a lot in this process. 

And we have produced some research findings and documentation:

- [solution for OAuth in Telegram](https://github.com/ctrlsa/smart-contract-wallet-Ethereum-Account-Abstraction-Telegram/pull/23/commits/793cc55f224a4574e32d6bd6e686f2184a6f0734)
- [Telegram + ZK solutions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BXHXLe0GFGT67eq8KWmVb5Ol9OaBvUcwDSIgOGIZJjc/edit?tab=t.0)
