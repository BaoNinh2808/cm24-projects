# Gardens

Gardens is a bottom-up governance framework for web3 ecosystems. We provide coordination infrastructure and funding mechanisms that help grow networks of public goods, run by the individuals and communities that understand them best.

Our emphasis is on a community experience that's healthy, fun, intuitive, secure, and open.

All of our code is open-source. Always has been and always will be. ðŸŒ±

## Architecture Overview

The Noble funding distribution platform is built as a modern Web3 application using a robust tech stack that prioritizes type safety, performance, and developer experience. The project follows a monorepo structure using Turborepo for efficient workspace management.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js 14**: Server-side rendering and modern React features
  - App Router for enhanced routing capabilities
  - Server Components for optimal performance
  - Server Actions for secure data mutations
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling with custom configuration
- **Viem**: Type-safe Ethereum interactions
- **Wagmi**: React Hooks for Ethereum
- **IPFS Integration**: For decentralized content storage

### Smart Contract Integration

- **Ethereum Interaction**: Via viem/wagmi
- **Contract Management**: Using Foundry for development and testing
- **The Graph**: For efficient blockchain data indexing
  - Custom subgraphs for event tracking
  - Local Graph Node for development

### Development Environment

- **Turborepo**: Monorepo management
- **pnpm**: Package management
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Docker**: Local development services

## Key Technical Approaches

### 1. Decentralized Governance

- Implementation of multi-signature wallets for Council and Tribunal safes
- IPFS integration for Covenant storage and retrieval
- On-chain voting mechanisms with off-chain data storage

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Server Components for reduced client-side JavaScript
- Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
- Efficient caching strategies using Turborepo

### 3. Security Measures

- Type-safe blockchain interactions
- Server-side validation
- Secure wallet connections
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations

### 4. Data Management

- The Graph for efficient blockchain data querying
- Hybrid storage approach (on-chain/off-chain)
- Real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions

### 5. User Experience

- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Responsive design using Tailwind
- Optimistic updates for blockchain transactions
- Comprehensive error handling

## Scalability Considerations

- Modular architecture for easy feature additions
- Efficient caching strategies
- Optimized blockchain interactions
- Subgraph pagination and filtering
- Remote caching for build optimization

## Security Features

- Strict TypeScript configurations
- Smart contract audit preparations
- Protected API routes
- Secure environment variable handling
- Multi-signature governance implementation

## Deployment Strategy

- Vercel for frontend deployment
- The Graph hosted service for subgraphs
- IPFS pinning services for decentralized storage
- Multi-network smart contract deployment support
