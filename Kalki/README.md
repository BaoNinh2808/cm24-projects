We present a new framework, called a key lattice, for managing keys in concurrent group messaging.
Our framework can be seen as a “key management” layer that enables concurrent group messaging
when secure pairwise channels are available. Security of group messaging protocols defined using the
key lattice incorporates both FS and PCS simply and naturally. Our framework combines both FS
and PCS into directional variants of the same abstraction, and additionally avoids dependence on
time-based epochs.
