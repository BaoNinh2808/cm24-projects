## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

Our project has four milestones:

	1.	Support Plonky3-FRI with a multi-degree folding feature.
	2.	Implement STIR as an additional Low-Degree-Test module within Plonky3.
	3.	Develop the STIR Recursive Circuit.
	4.	Implement the STIR verifier on Bitcoin using OP_CAT.

We have completed the first milestone, and the second milestone is nearly complete; we just need to finish a few tasks and optimize the code. After Devcon, we plan to focus on reaching the third and final milestones.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

We learned some about the future development of ZK and hope to devote ourselves to the great journey of building ZK.
