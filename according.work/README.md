## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

Some future plans:
- Implement comprehensive project management features, such as sprint planning.
- Establish connections between GitHub projects and Web3 projects, enabling project analysis based on on-chain and developer data.
- Officially release the product and pursue deep collaborations with various communities.
- ZK based Oracle Service to prove open-source contributions

We really need to get some real customers to use the project. Maybe we can cooperate together to help all the projects in invisible keep running.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

- What are the most important takeaways from your project?
For invisible garden, I really learned a lot from ZK. It is really cool to see how ZK can be used in real products.

- Are there any patterns or best practices that you've learned that would be useful for other projects?
Write zk circuits is not easy. If there are some open-source zk circuits or tools, you can use them in your project.

- Highlight reusable code patterns, key code snippets, and best practices - what are some of the ‘lego bricks’ you’ve built, and how could someone else best use them?
You can always write a SDK for your contract, so that the frontend and backend can interact with your contract easily and reduce the cost of communication.
