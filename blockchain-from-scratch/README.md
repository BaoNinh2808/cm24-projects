# Blockchain from Scratch

This project aims to implement a simple blockchain from scratch using Golang. 
I'm new in web3, so i created this project to help beginners like me to understand the core components of blockchain technology, such as block creation, chain linking, and mining algorithms.

## Technical Approach

- **Components** (Select all that apply)
  - [ ] Frontend
  - [X] Backend
  - [ ] Smart Contracts
  - [ ] ZK Circuits
  - [ ] Machine Learning (ML)

- Golang: Write basic blockchain data structures, block transactions, cli command execution, and node network communication
- BoltDB: A pure Go key/value store Db, we use it to persisit and store suce as blockchain state and transactions

## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

**1. Short-term Goals**
- This is just a basic implementation of Bitcoin. I plan to iteratively build on it, including implementing more consensus algorithms and refining the transaction model.
- Create a tutorial document to guide others step-by-step through this project, helping them gain a deeper understanding of blockchain fundamentals.

**2. Long-term Goals**

build a user-friendly and highly customizable blockchain framework, enabling developers to more easily and quickly dive into the core of blockchain development.

**Feature Enhancements**:
- Development in multiple programming languages
- Custom consensus algorithms, including but not limited to PoW, PoS, PoA, PBFT, and more
- Custom block validation and transaction validation logic, as well as rules for packaging transactions from the transaction pool
- Insertion of custom operations at various stages of block generation, including control over when transactions are executed
- Customization of on-chain transactions (i.e., Writing, referred to as transactions on Ethereum) and queries (Reading)
- Custom chain structure (including fork logic) and transaction pool logic
- Dependency injection for managing various business modules (Tripod)



## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

> What are the most important takeaways from your project?

Implementing a simple blockchain from scratch step by step helped me gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of Bitcoin and made me more confident in future blockchain development.

> Are there any patterns or best practices that you've learned that would be useful for other projects?

> Highlight reusable code patterns, key code snippets, and best practices - what are some of the ‘lego bricks’ you’ve built, and how could someone else best use them?
