# zklings

**zklings** is a repository aims to educate developers about implementation around zero-knowledge proofs via dozen of small exercises. This repository is forked from Rust's [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

Currently, we have included exercises in various topics in zero-knowledge proof implementation e.g. circom circuit, inner product arguments, finite fields, commitment schemes. We also improved circuit exercises checking workflow in order to make learner understands implementation flow of it too.

## Technical Approach

- **Components** (Select all that apply)
  - [ ] Frontend
  - [ ] Backend
  - [ ] Smart Contracts
  - [x] ZK Circuits
  - [ ] Machine Learning (ML)

- High-level outline of the main technical components, tech you used and approaches used in the project.

- Use Rust for implementing terminal GUI, controlling exercises and exercise checking process
- For exercises, we have exercises that use these langauges
  - Rust
  - circom
- Use commands from snarkjs for compiling, generating proof and verifying for checking circuit-related exercises
